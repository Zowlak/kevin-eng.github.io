### Hello guys and girls !

Let's start to talk about where I come from and to present you my region and what can we do in !  
I born (and I stay for my last 18 years) in Lannion, juste here :  
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/lannion.png)

It is a small town with less than 30 000 inhabitants, it is good to live there, there are a lot of colleges, high schools and higher schools, bars, shops, something to eat, there is everything to live quietly!  
Regarding the Bretagne, our beautiful region is located in the West of France.  
To summarize: beautiful walks, the sea, good specialties to taste, our crepes and our cider and a region that welcomes a lot of employment!
