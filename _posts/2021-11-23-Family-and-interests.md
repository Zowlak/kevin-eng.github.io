### Hello guys and girls !

I'm KÃ©vin, a french 18 years old student and I live with my mother at Lannion !  
I don't have much to say about my family, I am an only child and have lived alone with my mother for a few years. Whenever I have the chance, I go see my grandparents with whom I sometimes go on vacation in a motorhome!

### Now i will talk about my interests and different hobbies !

In everyday life, I'm more a homebody.  
Indeed, I like to stay at home to practice my various hobbies. I find friends to play video games with them, I find others to participate in cybersecurity competitions (CTF), I participate in projects that interest me, I watch series. I'm also very interested in motorcycles, whether it's the motorcycle world championships or just riding.
