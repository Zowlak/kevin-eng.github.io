### Hello guys and girls !

Let's start by talking about my inspirations and my goals.  
First of all, as I say, I am passionate about cybersecurity and new technologies.  
I am fascinated by how Elon Musk has risen through the ranks in his life despite all the problems he may have encountered.  
Likewise, I quite admire people like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.  
Regarding my goals, I want to continue my training in cybersecurity by taking the cybersecurity option in the 2nd year of my BUT. 
I would also like to discover the world of work by going on a work-study program and then be able to return to ESNA in Bretagne.
Then I would like to work as an independent entrepreneur in cybersecurity by offering pentesting services (discovery of computer vulnerabilities) to companies.
